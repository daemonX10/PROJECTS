Note Article 129
The Supreme Court shall be the court of record and has all the powers of such a court, including the power to punish for contempt of itself.


Article 131
The Supreme Court has the original jurisdiction in any dispute between the Government of India and one or more States; or between the Government of India and any State or States on one side and one or more other States on the other; or between two or more States.
 
Article 132
An appeal shall lie to the Supreme Court from any judgment, decree or final order, in a civil, criminal or other proceeding, if the High Court certifies under Article 134A that the case involves a substantial question of law as to the interpretation of the Constitution.


Article 133
An appeal shall lie to the Supreme Court from any judgment, decree or final order in a civil proceeding of a High Court in the territory of India, if the High Court certifies under Article 134A of the Constitution that the case involves a substantial question of law of general importance and, in the opinion of the High Court, the said question needs to be decided by the Supreme Court.
Notwithstanding anything contained in this Article, no appeal shall, unless Parliament by law or otherwise provides, lie to the Supreme Court from the judgment, decree or final order of one Judge of a High Court.


Article 134
An appeal shall lie to the Supreme Court from any judgment, final order or sentence in a criminal proceeding of a High Court in the territory of India, if the High Court has, on appeal, reversed an order of acquittal of an accused person and sentenced him to death; or has withdrawn for trial before itself any case from any court subordinate to its authority and has, in such trial, convicted the accused person and sentenced him to death; or if the High Court certifies under Article 134A that the case is a fit one for appeal to the Supreme Court, subject to the proviso thereunder.
 
Article 136
Notwithstanding anything contained in Chapter IV of the Constitution, the Supreme Court may in its discretion, grant special leave to appeal from any judgment, decree, determination, sentence or order in any cause or matter passed or made by any court or tribunal, except in relation to any court or tribunal constituted by or under any law relating to the armed forces.
Article 136 does not confer a right of appeal on any party but it confers a discretionary power on the Supreme Court to interfere in suitable cases.
The jurisdiction conferred by Article 136 is divisible into two stages; first stage is upto the disposal of prayer for special leave to file an appeal and the second stage commences if and when the leave to appeal is granted and special leave petition is converted into an appeal.
Under Article 136, the Supreme Court may reverse, modify or affirm the judgment, decree or order appealed against while exercising its appellate jurisdiction and not while exercising the discretionary jurisdiction disposing of petition for special leave to appeal. The doctrine of merger, therefore, applies to the former and not to the latter. Once leave to appeal has been granted and appellate jurisdiction of Supreme Court has been invoked, the order passed in appeal would attract the doctrine of merger; the order may be of reversal, modification or merely affirmation.
On an appeal having been preferred or a petition seeking leave to appeal having been converted into an appeal before the Supreme Court, the jurisdiction of the High Court to entertain a review petition is lost thereafter, as provided by sub-rule (1) of Rule (1) of Order 47 of the Code.
 
Article 137
Subject to the provisions of any law made by the Parliament or any rules made under Article 145, the Supreme Court shall have the power to review any judgment pronounced or order made by it.
The Supreme Court has held that “by describing an application as one for clarification or modification, though it is one for review, a party cannot be permitted to circumvent or bypass the circulation procedure and indirectly obtain a hearing in the open court. The Court has further held that what cannot be done directly cannot be permitted to be done indirectly and that an application for ‘clarification’, ‘modification’ or ‘recall’ cannot be entertained where, in sum and substance, the same is clever move for review [APSRTC and Others v. Abdul Kareem [2007 (2) SCC 466].
Article 139A(1)
Where cases involving the same or substantially the same questions of law are pending before the Supreme Court and one or more High Courts or before two or more High Courts and the Supreme Court is satisfied on its own motion or an application made by the Attorney- General of India or by a party to any such case that such questions are substantial questions of general importance, the Supreme Court may withdraw the case or cases pending before the High Court or the High Courts and dispose of all the cases itself:
Provided that the Supreme Court may after determining the said questions of law return any case so withdrawn together with a copy of its judgment on such questions to the High Court from which the case has been withdrawn and the High Court shall, on receipt thereof, proceed to dispose of the case in conformity with such judgment.
 
Article 139A(2)
The Supreme Court may, if it deems it expedient so to do for the ends of justice, transfer any case, appeal or other proceedings pending before any High Court to any other High Court.
Article 141
The law declared by the Supreme Court is binding on all courts within the territory of India.
Article 142
The Supreme Court may pass such decree or make such order as is necessary for doing complete justice in any cause or matter pending before it and it shall be enforceable throughout the territory of India in such manner as may be prescribed by or under any law made by Parliament and, until provision in that behalf is so made, in such manner as the President may by order prescribe.
Subject to the provisions of any law made in this behalf by Parliament, the Supreme Court shall, as respects the whole of the territory of India, have all and every power to make any order for the purpose of securing the attendance of any person, the discovery or production of any documents, or the investigation or punishment of any contempt of itself.


Article 143
Where a question of law or fact, which is of public importance, has arisen or is likely to arise and if the President is of the view that it is expedient to obtain the opinion of the Supreme Court upon it, he may refer the question to it for consideration and the Supreme Court may, after such hearing as it thinks fit, report to the President its opinion thereon.
 
Notwithstanding anything contained in the proviso to Article 131, the President may refer a dispute of the kind mentioned in the said proviso to the Supreme Court for opinion and the Supreme Court shall, after such hearing as it thinks fit, report to the President its opinion thereon.
Article 144
All civil and judicial authorities in the territory of India shall act in aid of the Supreme Court.
Article 145
Subject to the provisions of any law made by the Parliament, the Supreme Court may, from time to time, with the approval of the President, make rules for regulating generally the practice and procedure of the Court.
Article 32
The Supreme Court shall have power to issue directions or orders or writs, including writs in the nature of habeas corpus, mandamus, prohibition, quo warranto and certiorari, whichever may be appropriate, for the enforcement of any of the rights conferred by Part III of the Constitution.
Under the Extra-ordinary Original Jurisdiction, a writ petition in the nature of public interest litigation can be filed in the Supreme Court.

The Supreme Court shall, inter alia, have powers to transfer any case relating to the State of Jammu and Kashmir under Article 32 of the Constitution. [Anita Kushwaha vs. Pushap Sudan (Transfer Petition (C) No. 1343 of 2008)]
Even after a death sentence has been confirmed and is not open to review, the Supreme Court may, under Article 32 read with Article 21, commute the sentence of death into one of life imprisonment on

ASSISTANT REGISTRAR
 
Annexure I
SUPREME COURT OF INDIA COMPILATION OF GUIDELINES TO BE FOLLOWED FOR
ENTERTAINING LETTERS/PETITIONS RECEIVED

IN THIS COURT AS PUBLIC INTEREST LITIGATION.
(Based on full Court decision dated 1.12.1988 and subsequent modifications).

No petition involving individual/ personal matter shall be entertained as a PIL matter except as indicated hereinafter.

Letter-petitions falling under the following categories alone will ordinarily be entertained as Public Interest Litigation:-

1.	Bonded Labour matters.
2.	Neglected Children.
3.	Non-payment of minimum wages to workers and exploitation of casual workers and complaints of violation of Labour Laws (except in individual cases).
4.	Petitions from jails complaining of harassment, for (pre-mature release)* and seeking release after having completed 14 years in jail, death in jail, transfer, release on personal bond, speedy trial as a fundamental right.
*$ Petitions for premature release, parole etc. are not matters which deserve to be treated as petitions u/Article 32 as they can effectively be dealt with by the concerned High Court. To save time Registry may simultaneously call for remarks of the jail Superintendent and ask him to forward the same to High Court. The main petition may be forwarded to the concerned High Court for disposal in accordance with law.
Even in regard to petitions containing allegations against Jail Authorities there is no reason why it cannot be dealt with by the High Court. But petitions complaining of torture, custody death and the like may be entertained by this Court directly if the allegations are of a serious nature.
(5)	Petitions against police for refusing to register a case, harassment by police and death in police custody.
(6)	Petitions against atrocities on women, in particular harassment of bride, bride- burning, rape, murder, kidnapping etc.

+ In such cases where office calls for police report if letter petitioner asks for copy the same may be supplied, only after obtaining permission of the Hon'ble Judge nominated by the Hon'ble Chief Justice of India for PIL matters.
$ Added based on Order dated 19.8.1993 of the then Chief Justice of India.
 

(7)	Petitions complaining of harassment or torture of villagers by co- villagers or by police from persons belonging to Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribes and economically backward classes.
(8)	Petitions pertaining to environmental pollution, disturbance of ecological balance, drugs, food adulteration, maintenance of heritage and culture, antiques, forest and wild life and other matters of public importance.
(9)	Petitions from riot -victims.
(10)	Family Pension.

All letter-petitions received in the PIL Cell will first be screened in the Cell and only such petitions as are covered by the above mentioned categories will be placed before a Judge to be nominated by Hon'ble the Chief Justice of India for directions after which the case will be listed before the Bench concerned.
If a letter-petition is to be lodged, the orders to that effect should be passed by Registrar (Judicial) (or any Registrar nominated by the Hon'ble Chief Justice of India), instead of Additional Registrar, or any junior officer.
To begin with only one Hon'ble Judge may be assigned this work and number increased to two or three later depending on the workload.

*Submission Notes be put up before an Hon'ble Judge nominated for such periods as may be decided by the Hon'ble Chief Justice of India from time to time.
**If on scrutiny of a letter petition, it is found that the same is not covered under the PIL guidelines and no public interest is involved, then the same may be lodged only after the approval from the Registrar nominated by the Hon'ble the Chief Justice of India.

**It may be worthwhile to require an affidavit to be filed in support of the statements contained in the petition whenever it is not too onerous a requirement.




+ Added as per Order dated 29.8.2003 of the Hon'ble Chief Justice of India.

* As per Order dated 29.8.2003 of the Hon'ble the Chief Justice of India.
 
**The matters which can be dealt with by the High Court or any other authority may be sent to them without any comment whatsoever instead of all such matters being heard judicially in this Court only.
Cases falling under the following categories will not be entertained as Public Interest Litigation and these may be returned to the petitioners or filed in the PIL Cell, as the case may be:

(1)	Landlord-Tenant matters.
(2)	Service matter and those pertaining to Pension and Gratuity.
(3)	Complaints against Central/ State Government Departments and Local Bodies except those relating to item Nos. (1) to (10) above.
(4)	Admission to medical and other educational institution.
(5)	Petitions for early hearing of cases pending in High Courts and Subordinate Courts.

In regard to the petitions concerning maintenance of wife, children and parents, the petitioners may be asked to file a Petition under sec. 125 of Cr. P.C. Or a Suit in the Court of competent jurisdiction and for that purpose to approach the nearest Legal Aid Committee for legal aid and advice.
